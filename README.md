Keylogger for linux/X that gathers aggregate stats about your
typing. The results include total keypress counts per measurement
window, plus a bit of detail about which keys you tend to type and
then backspace, and which ones you type right after using backspace.

Uses https://github.com/amoffat/pykeylogger for the X code.
